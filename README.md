Decoding of different hand gestures (as per ASL) 
-------------------
Future works: 
1- implementing the whole code in python inorder to make it opensource
2- also a better implementation and proper python gui need to be added
3- use of deep learning and required algorithms for improved results
4- putting everything in a single app (.exe)
